== Description ==

Adds basic REST API support, a language switcher block and a selector to filter blocks by language in the block widgets screen to the free version of Polylang.

This plugin was developed primarily for my personal use to bridge specific feature gaps. As such, it is provided "as-is" without any official support or updates. If you require a stable, fully-supported solution with regular updates and professional assistance, I recommend purchasing a copy of Polylang Pro: https://polylang.pro/

== Installation ==
1. Upload the extracted plugin folder and contained files to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress
